# SOAR-EDR

<img width="573" alt="Screen Shot 2025-02-17 at 6 53 05 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5a821d3-473e-46f6-9fe9-e345d73e033f" /> <br>

In this project I build a <b>SOAR (Security Orchestration and Automated Response)</b> tool with <b>Tines</b> (Automated Workflow builder) and with <b>LimaCharlie</b> as the EDR (Endpoint Detection Response) tool. 
<br />

<br>
<h3>Languages and Utilities Used</h3>

- <b>Vultr.com</b> -- Launching a Windows[Uploading EDR&SOAR.drawioâ€¦]()
 Server/Virtual Machine
- <b>Tines</b> -- An automnation platform 
- <b>Lima Charlie</b> (EDR & Versatile Security Monitoring Tool) 
- <b>Lazagne</b>-- An open-source credential harvesting tool which gathers credentials from browsers, databases and more.
<br>


<h2> Step 1 -- Build A WorkFlow Diagram </h2>
<h3>Everything starts when LimaCharlie detects a malicious program on our computer! The malicious program in this case is LaZagne. Eventually A User Prompt is given to isolate the machine and Email/Slack messages with more detail are sent.</h3><br>

<h2> Step 2 -- Install a Lima harlie Agent on the Windows Virtual Machine</h2>
<h3>This will allow LimaCharlie to detect and report any suspicious activity and get our automated workthrough started</h3>h3>

The command to install the agent is comprised of the <strong><LaZagne executable/strong>, -i character and CharlieLima sensor Id.

<br>


<h2> Step 3 -- Create LimaCharlie Detection Rules</h2>
<p>Creating Detection Rules helps LimaCharlie know what to look for on the target machine! On the LimaCharlie home screen navigate to Automation and then D&R</p> <br>

<br> <br>

These rules look for a new or existing process that: 

 - Contains a windows operating system AND

 * Any of these other conditions:
   
 - The File Path ends in Lazagne.exe
 - Command line ends with "all"
 - Command line contains "LaZagne"
 - The binary hash is '3cc5ee..." (seen in picture)
<br> <br>


<h2> Step 4 -- Run Lazagne on Virtual Machine and discover Credentials </h2>
<p>LaZagne is used by Digital Forensic Professionals, Pen Testers and Bad Actors</p> <br>

h2> Step 5 -- When Lazagne Runs on our Virtual Machine, LimaCharlie alerts our Automation program Tines </h2>
<p>Tines then sends out a Slack Message and Email with details about the alert</p>

<br> <br>



h2> Step 6 -- A User Prompt is sent to the user asking if they want to isolate the endpoint </h2>

h2> If the User decides to Isolate the Endpoint then LimaCharlie will Isolate it from the network </h2>

<p>Before Removing our virtual machine from the Network we can ping websites from Powershell in our Windows VM</p> <br>

<p>After Removing our virtual machine from the Network we can no longer ping any websites! </p> <br>

h2> A Final Slack & Email Message is Sent Confirming the Isolation of that endpoint/machine </h2>

<h2>Email Isolation Message Confirmation </h2>

<h2>Final Takeaways</h2>

<P>How cool is it to be able to isolate a machine! In the real word this is extremely important to be able to stop malware/ransomware or any other malicious program from spreading throughout the network. It is almost like removing cancer from the body before it can spread!</P>
