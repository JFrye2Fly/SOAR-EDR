# SOAR-EDR

In this project I build a <b>SOAR (Security Orchestration and Automated Response)</b> tool with <b>Tines</b> (Automated Workflow builder) and with <b>LimaCharlie</b> as the EDR (Endpoint Detection Response) tool. 
<br />

 Server/Virtual Machine
- <b>Tines</b> -- An automnation platform 
- <b>Lima Charlie</b> (EDR & Versatile Security Monitoring Tool) 
- <b>Lazagne</b>-- An open-source credential harvesting tool which gathers credentials from browsers, databases and more.

<p align=left> AFter launching the virtual machine "TPOT" in the Azure Cloud many malicious hackers 
began their attempts to hack the virtual machine. This a live attack map. As you can see countries from all over the world tried to exploit this vulnerable VM.</p>
