# SOAR-EDR

In this project I build a <b>SOAR (Security Orchestration and Automated Response)</b> tool with <b>Tines</b> (Automated Workflow builder) and with <b>LimaCharlie</b> as the EDR (Endpoint Detection Response) tool. 
<br />

<br>
<h3>Languages and Utilities Used</h3>

- <b>Vultr.com</b> -- Launching a Windows[Uploading EDR&SOAR.drawio…]()
 Server/Virtual Machine
- <b>Tines</b> -- An automnation platform 
- <b>Lima Charlie</b> (EDR & Versatile Security Monitoring Tool) 
- <b>Lazagne</b>-- An open-source credential harvesting tool which gathers credentials from browsers, databases and more.
<br>


<h2> Step 1 -- Build A WorkFlow Diagram </h2>
<h3>Everything starts when LimaCharlie detects a malicious program on our computer! The malicious program in this case is LaZagne.</h3><br>

<p align=left> After launching the virtual machine "TPOT" in the Azure Cloud many malicious hackers 
began their attempts to hack the virtual machine. This a live attack map. As you can see countries from all over the world tried to exploit this vulnerable VM.</p>
