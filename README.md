SOAR &amp; EDR Project

<h2>In this project I build a SOAR (Security Orchestration and Automated Response) tool with Tines (Automated Workflow builder) and with LimaCharlie as the EDR (Endpoint Detection Response) tool. </h2>
<br />

<h3>Languages and Utilities Used</h3>

- <b>Lima Charlie</b> (EDR & Versatile Security Monitoring Tool) 
- <b>Lazagne</b>-- An open-source credential harvesting tool which gathers credentials from browsers, databases and more. 


<h3 align="left">Attack Map -- Honey Pot</h3>
<p align=left> AFter launching the virtual machine "TPOT" in the Azure Cloud many malicious hackers 
began their attempts to hack the virtual machine. This a live attack map. As you can see countries from all over the world tried to exploit this vulnerable VM.</p>
